## Notes

I enjoyed making this app! I learned a lot about how to use Andrios Studio, creating and working with the emulator, and how to 
create a simple app that is relevant to daily life. I had a challenge when the video tutorial didn't line up with what I was seeing on my
laptop screen, but once I figured out what the tutorial was trying to accomplish I was able to replicate it to make my app work properly. This
project allowed me to get a basic understanding of a new IDE, a new language (Kotlin) that is similar to ones I have worked with previously (Java),
and I was able to see correlations with the steps and process of app development between iOS and Andriod, given my prior experience with the
iOS Development course I tookwith Codepath.
